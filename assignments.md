Assignments are count for 25% of your final grade. Most of the assignments are graded with [gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/). You need to create an account and add yourself to the course with the entry code: MPKB3Y.

Homework expectations,

- Completely explain your solutions. Correct answers without clear explanations will not receive full credit.
- Homeworks must be completed individually. Discussion with others is okay, but you must write solutions yourself.
- All code used to arrive at answers is submitted along with answers. If you submit an export of an IPython notebook, you must also separately submit code as a `.py` file.
- Code will be graded according to style in addition to functionality.
