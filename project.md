The goal of this project is to build a system for automatic recognition of the age, gender, and personality of social media users. When given as input users' genderate content (e.g., text, image and relations), this system should return as output the age, gender and personality trait scores of that user.

## Project Grading

The project counts for 35% of your final grade.  The project will be graded out of a total of 35 points as follows:

- Results on the scoreboard on week 3:  2 points.  If your results are at least as good as the baseline forall prediction tasks, your team gets full credit for this part.

- In-class  progress  update  on  week  7:  8  points.   This  is  a  group  presentation,  with  slides.   All  teammembers should present.  Students who do not present can not get credit for this part.

- Final in-class presentation on Week 13:  7 points.  This is a group presentation, with slides.  All teammembers should present.  Students who do not present can not get credit for this part.  We will decideat random at the beginning of the lecture on the last weel which teams will present on Tuesday and which teams will present on Thursday.

- Code and documentation:  8 points

- Report:  10 points (= 8 points group report + 2 points individual report)

Your grade for the progress updates is based on a 5 minute presentation in class (approx. 2-3 slides) and the results of your software so far.
